/**
 * IS THE RELEASE ACTUALLY LIVE — in npm, on GitHub, and in Zenodo?
 *
 * LEARNED FROM @uuidna/qpu, which built this first. The runner is that discipline; the facts are school's own,
 * because a release check that names another package's archive checks nothing about this one.
 *
 * publish.yml does three things and confirms none of them. It creates a GitHub Release, publishes to npm with
 * provenance, and exits green on the fact that the COMMANDS returned zero. That is a different claim from the
 * release being reachable: npm's PUT can succeed while the version is not yet served by the registry, a
 * provenance attestation is a separate object that can be absent from a publish that otherwise worked, and
 * Zenodo archives through a GitHub webhook that fires minutes later and can silently not fire at all.
 *
 * The drift this exists to catch is already in the tree. CITATION.cff says `version: 0.1.3` and its own archive
 * identifier says "Archived version 0.1.1" — two releases went out and the archive has one of them. Nothing
 * reported that, because nothing was asking.
 *
 * THREE OUTCOMES, NOT TWO. A check is `live`, `waiting`, or `unverifiable`, and the third is not a failure:
 * Zenodo's API shape has changed before and an unauthenticated GitHub API call is rate-limited, so "this host
 * would not answer" must not be reported as "the release is missing". Only a check that definitively answered
 * "not there" after the whole budget fails the run. The same rule the rest of this package keeps — an absent
 * instrument voids, it does not disagree.
 *
 *   node scripts/verify-release.mjs             the version in package.json
 *   node scripts/verify-release.mjs 0.1.4       a version named explicitly
 *
 *   VERIFY_ATTEMPTS  how many rounds before giving up (default 30)
 *   VERIFY_EVERY_MS  pause between rounds        (default 10000)
